# Arrays

# What are the two ways you can add "d" on to the end of the following array?
         letters = ["a", "b", "c"]

# How would you access the "b" in the following array?
         letters = ["a", "b", "c"]

# How would you access the "z" in the following array?
         letters = ["a", "b",  ["x", "y", "z"]]

# (optional): What am I doing wrong if I'm trying to access "x"
          letters = ["a", "b",  ["x", "y", "z"]]
          letters[2[0]]


# Which is the hash and which is the array?
   ["a", "b", "c"]           {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}

# How would you access the 2 in the following hash?
   letter_hash = {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}


# Arrays are organized by ____________, hashes are organized by _____________

# How would you access the "26" in the following hash?
   letter_hash = {"a" => 1, "b" => {"x" => 24, "y" => 25, "z" => 26 }, "c" => 3}

# How would you access Arjun's neighborhood, starting with the staff variable?
staff = [
   arjun = { "name" => {"first" => "Arjun", "last" => "Venkataswamy"}, "address" => {"neighborhood" => "Wicker Park", "zip" => 60622}}
   raghu = { "name" => {"first" => "Raghu", "last" => "Betina"}, "address" => {"neighborhood" => "Lincoln Park", "zip" => 60614}}
   jeff = { "name" => {"first" => "Jeff", "last" => "Cohen"}, "address" => {"neighborhood" => "Skokie", "zip" => 60077}}
]


# For the following lists, choose whether an array or a hash is more appropriate?
   # 1. A list that you're going to be accessing by descriptive keywords
   # 2. A list where order matters
   # 3. A list that will eventually have an unknown number of elements
