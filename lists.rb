# You should definitely know:

# How would you access the "b" in the following array?
#          letters = ["a", "b", "c"]


# What are the two ways you can add "d" on to the end of the following array?
#          letters = ["a", "b", "c"]


# Which is the hash and which is the array?
#    ["a", "b", "c"]           {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}


# How would you access the 2 in the following hash?
#    letter_hash = {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}


# How would you add the key-value pair of "d" => 4 to the following hash?
#    letter_hash = {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}


# Arrays are organized by ____________, hashes are organized by _____________


# How would you access the "z" in the following array?
#          letters = ["a", "b",  ["x", "y", "z"]]


# How would you access the "26" in the following hash?
#    letter_hash = {"a" => 1, "b" => {"x" => 24, "y" => 25, "z" => 26 }, "c" => 3}


# (optional): What am I doing wrong if I'm trying to access "x"
#           letters = ["a", "b",  ["x", "y", "z"]]
#           letters[2[0]]

# For the following lists, choose whether an array or a hash is more appropriate?
#    1. A list that you're going to be accessing by descriptive keywords
#    2. A list that you're going to be accessing by order
#    3. A list that will contain an unknown number of elements
#    4. A list of student names and descriptors
#    5. A list of students
#    6. A chronological list of events
#    7. A list of customer information
